# cadence-task-worker

This project is a **Temporal (formerly Cadence)** worker written in Go. It runs a workflow that:

1. Authenticates a user using provided credentials.
2. Uses the received token to call an external **Task API** and create a task.

This allows you to orchestrate task creation reliably using Temporal workflows.

Cadence UI address : http://localhost:8233/
